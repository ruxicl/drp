### Fall 2022: Dependent type theory - why, how and what do with it?

_Abstract_: Set theory has become the common way to approach the foundations of mathematics. In this talk, we aim to introduce dependent type theory and make a case for it as an alternative way of discussing the foundations.  Along the way, we will ponder its different interpretations. Finally, we will argue its utility by introducing the type theory-based proof assistant Coq and its library UniMath.


### Spring 2023: Categorifying computability
_Abstract_: In this talk, we aim to make a case for using category theory as a way of understanding computability. We define a category of functions, in which the objects are types, and the morphisms between any types $t_1$ and $t_2$ are functions of input of type $t_1$ and output of type $t_2$. In this new categorical set-up, we will define different subsets of natural numbers - recursive, recursively enumerable, productive, based on the computability of their characteristic functions.
