## Dependent type theory - why and how?

_Abstract_: This talk aims to make a case for dependent type theory as a way to discuss foundations of Mathematics. We will ponder different interpretations, introduce several dependent types, and look at connections with category theory. Finally, we will introduce the type theory-based proof assistant Coq along with its library UniMath, and demonstrate what it can and cannot (yet) do.
