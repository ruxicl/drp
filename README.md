## Dependent type theory - why, how and what do with it?

_Abstract_: Set theory has become the common way to approach the foundations of mathematics. In this talk, we aim to introduce dependent type theory and make a case for it as an alternative way of discussing the foundations.  Along the way, we will ponder its different interpretations. Finally, we will argue its utility by introducing the type theory-based proof assistant Coq and its library UniMath.
